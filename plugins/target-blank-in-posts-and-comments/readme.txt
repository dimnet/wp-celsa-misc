Keep your visitors on your blog. UPDATE: [due to usability issues](http://www.inverudio.com/programs/WordPressBlog/NewTabWindowTargetBlankPlugin.php) I don't recommend using this plugin as some visitors are annoyed by creation of new tabs/windows.


== Description ==

Opens external links in new tab/window so that use doesn't need to click 'BACK' button to find your blog again. 

Version 2.0: Fixed the bug occuring with javascript links...

== Installation ==

1. Unzip into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. If you're uploading it make sure to upload
the top-level folder. Don't just upload all the php files and put them in `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it!
